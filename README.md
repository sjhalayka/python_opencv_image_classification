Step 1: run get_files.py to create the training and testing data sets.

Step 2: run ann_image.py to train and test the artificial neural network using the training and testing data sets.

The code also trains using the Caltech 256 data set with minimal changes to get_files.py (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/)
