Step 1: run get_files.py to create the training and testing data sets.

Step 2: run ann_image.py to train and test the artificial neural network using the training and testing data sets.

The code also trains using the Caltech 256 data set with minimal changes to get_files.py plus the creation of meta/classes.txt and meta/labels.txt files -- these can be created on Windows by doing a 'dir /b' on the command line
